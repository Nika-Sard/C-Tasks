## **Task 1: Calculations Async**
This task demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming in C#. The main goal was to implement a set of calculations using `async` and `await` to enhance performance.

- **Key Concepts:** Asynchronous programming, performance optimization.
- **Folder:** `calculations-async/`

---

## **Task 2: Country Services Async**
Developed asynchronous services to fetch and process country-related data efficiently. Emphasis was on using RESTful APIs and managing concurrency.

- **Key Concepts:** RESTful APIs, asynchronous operations, concurrency management.
- **Folder:** `country-services-async/`

---

## **Task 3: JSON Serialization Upskill**
Focused on serializing and deserializing complex JSON data structures. The task emphasized best practices in working with JSON in C#.

- **Key Concepts:** JSON serialization/deserialization, `Newtonsoft.Json`, error handling.
- **Folder:** `json-serialization-upskill/`

---

## **Task 4: Onway's Game of Life**
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C#. This task involved simulating cellular automata and implementing the game logic.

- **Key Concepts:** Cellular automata, algorithm optimization.
- **Folder:** `onways-game-of-life/`

---

## **Task 5: Palindrome Number Filtering**
Implemented logic to filter palindrome numbers from a large dataset. Focused on optimizing the algorithm for performance.

- **Key Concepts:** Algorithm design, performance optimization.
- **Folder:** `palindrome-number-filtering/`

---

## **Task 6: Sieve of Eratosthenes**
Implemented the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. The task emphasized algorithmic efficiency.

- **Key Concepts:** Prime number calculation, algorithm efficiency.
- **Folder:** `sieve-of-eratosthenes/`

---

## **Task 7: Thread Pool for Palindrome Filtering**
This task extended the palindrome filtering logic by incorporating multithreading using a thread pool.

- **Key Concepts:** Multithreading, thread pool management.
- **Folder:** `palindrome-number-filtering-thread-pool/`

---

## **Task 8: TPL Upskill**
Explored the Task Parallel Library (TPL) to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. The task involved implementing parallelized solutions to common problems.

- **Key Concepts:** Task Parallel Library, parallel programming.
- **Folder:** `tpl-upskill/`
